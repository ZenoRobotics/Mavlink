# Mavlink

## Purpose

The creation of this repository was for the purpose of keeping my notes, instructions, links, etc. in a single place where I can easily find it! :) Additionally, I hope that others will be able to benefit from my notes as well.

Mavlink and PyMavlink (see below for definitions) will be used here for offboard communication between a drone's companion computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi running linux) and the drone's flight controller. Both simulations and hardware setup information will be stored here.

## Definitions

Mavlink is a lightweight messaging protocol for drones and onboard drone components.

PyMAVLink provides a way for Python developers to build applications that communicate with MAVLink-enabled systems. It handles the low-level details of packing and unpacking MAVLink messages, making it easier to develop custom applications that interact with drones and other autonomous vehicles.

Information on the formats and definitions of Mavlink Standard Messages and Commands can be found on the Mavlink website: https://mavlink.io/en/messages/
